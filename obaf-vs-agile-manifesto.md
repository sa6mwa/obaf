The [**Outcome-Based Agile Framework**](https://github.com/sa6mwa/obaf) (OBAF) aligns **strongly and
thoughtfully** with the **original [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)**,
while evolving and extending its principles in a modern,
outcome-centric direction. Here's a breakdown of how well it fits with
Agile's foundational values and principles:

---

### üî∑ **Direct Alignment with the Agile Manifesto**

The Agile Manifesto values:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change over following a plan**

OBAF echoes and deepens these values:

| Agile Manifesto Value | OBAF Parallel |
|------------------------|----------------|
| *Individuals and interactions* | Emphasis on **team autonomy**, **problem ownership**, and **blameless retrospectives** honors trust in people over rigid structure. |
| *Working software* | OBAF refines this as "**observable change**," asserting that delivery is only meaningful if it changes behavior or value‚Äîthus *realigning working software with actual impact*. |
| *Customer collaboration* | OBAF insists on **continuous discovery** and using **evidence from users** as the core input for decision-making, even more deeply embedding the user‚Äôs voice. |
| *Responding to change* | OBAF treats all plans as **hypotheses**, welcoming adaptation as a default posture‚Äînot just reacting to change, but **expecting and seeking it through learning**. |

---

### üî∑ **Expansion of Agile's Intent**

OBAF updates Agile for a modern context where:

- Agile is often reduced to rituals (e.g., daily standups, story points) devoid of purpose.
- Many organizations still prioritize outputs and timelines over outcomes and learning.

Instead of merely aligning with the original Agile Manifesto, OBAF *reinterprets and extends it* to **re-center agility around impact**, with tenets like:

- **Outcomes over requirements** ‚Äì Aligns with Agile‚Äôs goal of delivering *value*, not just deliverables.
- **Discovery over certainty** ‚Äì Embeds Lean Startup and design thinking into Agile‚Äôs mindset.
- **Accountability to results over compliance to plans** ‚Äì Emphasizes **value creation**, not process adherence.
- **Evidence as arbiter** ‚Äì Grounds decisions in data and real-world feedback, strengthening the *empirical foundation* of Agile.

---

### üî∂ **Where It Diverges or Innovates (Not Contradicts)**

OBAF doesn't contradict the Agile Manifesto, but it *evolves it* in these ways:

- **Moves beyond ‚Äúworking software‚Äù** ‚Äì Instead of focusing on deliverables like code, it focuses on **measurable outcomes** such as behavior change or business impact.
- **Formalizes learning mechanisms** ‚Äì The structured AARs and evidence-driven decision-making process are **more explicit** than in the original Agile framework.
- **Introduces problem framing as core input** ‚Äì Agile focused on customer collaboration and iterative delivery, but OBAF **starts by reframing requirements as problems and constraints**, encouraging deeper inquiry up front.

These shifts represent a **natural progression** of Agile's core ideas, not a departure from them.

---

### ‚úÖ Overall Alignment Score: **9.5/10**

The Outcome-Based Agile Framework:
- Stays deeply true to Agile‚Äôs **spirit and values**
- Corrects common **misinterpretations** of Agile-as-process
- Adds needed emphasis on **learning, user impact, and strategic alignment**

It doesn‚Äôt just align with the Agile Manifesto‚Äîit **refreshes its relevance** for organizations seeking *real agility*, not just Agile theater.
