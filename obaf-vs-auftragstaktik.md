[Mission Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_command) or [Mission-type tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics)—known
as **_Auftragstaktik_** in German and
[Uppdragstaktik](https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/2-om-forsvarsmakten/dokument/doktriner/msd-22.pdf)
in Swedish—is a decentralized leadership philosophy used in military
doctrine that emphasizes **intent-based command**, **subordinate
initiative**, and **trust-based execution**.

Rather than issuing detailed instructions, commanders provide:

- **A clear mission (the “what”)**
- **The purpose behind the mission (the “why”)**
- **Boundaries or constraints (the “what not”)**

Subordinates are then empowered to decide **how** to achieve the
mission using their judgment and contextual understanding.

This philosophy originated in the **Prussian military** of the 19th
century and remains foundational in modern armed forces such as NATO,
Germany (Bundeswehr), and Sweden. It is especially valued in complex,
fast-changing environments where centralized control is too slow or
brittle.

### Key Principles:

1. **Commander’s Intent**: Clarity on the desired end state and why it matters.
2. **Decentralized Execution**: Subordinates act independently, using initiative.
3. **Trust & Competence**: Leaders trust teams to make decisions in ambiguity.
4. **Flexibility & Adaptability**: Plans are not sacred—**outcomes are.**

This command philosophy is designed for **high agility in uncertainty**, making it a close analog to modern approaches in agile software development and organizational leadership.

# OBAF vs Mission Command

The [Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF)](https://github.com/sa6mwa/obaf)
aligns **very closely** with the core principles of **Mission
Command** (German: *Auftragstaktik*), a decentralized command
philosophy used in military doctrine—especially in the German and NATO
traditions.

Here's a structured breakdown of how OBAF and Mission Command align:

---

### 🔷 Core Principles of Mission Command vs. OBAF

| **Mission Command Principle** | **OBAF Alignment** |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Clear intent over detailed orders** | OBAF emphasizes “**Strategy is intent, not instruction**,” where leaders set **desired outcomes** but not how to achieve them. |
| **Decentralized decision-making** | OBAF gives **teams autonomy** to solve problems, rejecting top-down control and empowering those closest to the work. |
| **Initiative within boundaries** | OBAF teams work **within constraints** but have full ownership of how to achieve outcomes—just like Auftragstaktik expects subordinate commanders to act flexibly within mission intent. |
| **Trust and empowerment** | OBAF builds trust by assigning **problem ownership**, expecting discovery and innovation from those doing the work. |
| **Shared understanding of purpose** | OBAF insists on **clarifying the purpose of each outcome**, ensuring all efforts are aligned to broader strategic goals. |
| **Rapid learning and adaptation** | OBAF mandates **continuous discovery and blameless After Action Reviews**, echoing Mission Command’s focus on adaptability and reflection. |

---

### 🔶 Cultural Alignment

- **Psychological Safety**: Mission Command assumes that mistakes are a part of initiative-taking. OBAF formalizes this through blameless retrospectives and celebration of diverse perspectives.
- **Autonomy + Responsibility**: Both frameworks **delegate authority but retain accountability** to results—not tasks or orders.
- **Anti-Bureaucratic**: Mission Command rejects micromanagement in favor of trust. OBAF’s “**Simplicity of governance**” mirrors this precisely.

---

### ✅ Summary

**OBAF is a civilian/agile-sector analog of Mission Command.** It captures the same spirit: empower those closest to the problem, ensure strategic clarity, and value adaptability over rigid control.

In short:
> **Mission Command in the military is what OBAF is to agile product teams.**
