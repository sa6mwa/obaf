# ‚öñÔ∏è Alignment of OBAF and DevOps Principles

---

## Overall Relationship

The [Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF)](https://github.com/sa6mwa/obaf)
and DevOps share **deep philosophical alignment**, but they operate at
**different layers of concern** inside an organization.

- OBAF focuses primarily on the **strategic and discovery layers** ‚Äî
  ensuring that teams solve the right problems and achieve meaningful
  outcomes through adaptive learning.
- DevOps focuses on the **engineering and operational layers** ‚Äî
  ensuring that the process of building, deploying, and operating
  solutions is fast, reliable, and safe.

While they target different stages of the value stream, **their
cultural values are highly compatible** and mutually reinforcing.

## Core Philosophical Similarities

Both OBAF and DevOps emphasize:

- **Rapid feedback loops:** OBAF demands continuous discovery and
  evidence-based decision-making. DevOps similarly insists on quick
  feedback from production environments to development teams.
- **Autonomous, cross-functional teams:** OBAF requires that teams own
  both problem discovery and solution delivery. DevOps advocates for
  end-to-end responsibility from build to run.
- **Blameless learning culture:** OBAF mandates blameless After Action
  Reviews (AARs) to surface learning opportunities without assigning
  personal blame. DevOps, especially as defined in _The DevOps
  Handbook_, emphasizes blameless postmortems after incidents.
- **Continuous improvement:** Both see learning and improvement as
  permanent, necessary parts of how organizations create value.
- **Evidence over assumptions:** OBAF bases all action on validated
  learning from real users; DevOps demands measuring operational
  performance (e.g., lead time, deployment frequency) to guide
  improvements.

In short: **OBAF and DevOps both replace guesswork and rigid plans
with feedback-driven adaptability.**

## Differences in Primary Focus

Despite the strong cultural alignment, the two frameworks are **not
interchangeable** because they address **different organizational
problems**:

- **OBAF** is about making sure that teams work on the *right things*
  ‚Äî outcomes that truly matter to users, businesses, and systems.
- **DevOps** is about ensuring that teams *efficiently and safely
  deliver* whatever solutions they decide to build.

Where OBAF is asking, *"Are we solving the right problem?"*, DevOps is
asking, *"How do we solve it and get it running in the real world
quickly and reliably?"*

OBAF would view delivery without learning or value as meaningless, no
matter how technically excellent it is. DevOps assumes the work being
delivered has value and focuses on making that delivery **fast,
frequent, and low-risk**.

## Where OBAF Adds to DevOps

OBAF fills a critical strategic gap often left open by many DevOps
initiatives. While DevOps improves the mechanics of delivering
software and operating it, it can sometimes fall into the trap of
**delivering the wrong things faster** if upstream decision-making is
flawed.

OBAF brings clarity to the upstream process by insisting that teams:

- Frame problems carefully.
- Continuously discover what users truly need.
- Adapt based on real-world evidence, not assumptions or executive
  guesses.

In this sense, OBAF and DevOps together form a **full-spectrum learning loop**:  
**From discovery ‚Üí to delivery ‚Üí to operational feedback ‚Üí to learning
‚Üí to better discovery.**

# üß≠ Final Summary

**OBAF and DevOps are highly compatible but operate on different stages of the product and system lifecycle.**  
Their shared emphasis on feedback, learning, autonomy, and
evidence-based decision-making makes them natural allies.

OBAF ensures you are *solving the right problems*, while DevOps
ensures you *solve them the right way* ‚Äî efficiently, safely, and
sustainably.

Together, they can radically accelerate an organization's ability to
learn, adapt, and deliver real-world value.
