# OBAF vs Lean

**DISCLAIMER!**  
The following text was generated by ChatGPT-4o on April 29, 2025, in
response to the prompt: *How well do these ideas align with Lean
principles, Lean Enterprise, or Lean Startup?*

As expected, the ideas align well with Lean thinking. Perhaps OBAF
should emphasize understanding the problem before starting
work. However, there is a risk of prematurely pairing problems with
solutions—before fully grasping the *purpose* behind the problems
themselves. This may be a semantic difference between ChatGPT's
interpretation of OBAF and my own.

That said, I agree that OBAF is leaner than Lean in terms of upfront
requirements. While Lean often allows for some upfront
specification—particularly in high-compliance environments—I
intentionally advocate for *zero* requirements up front. My goal is to
stay grounded in *first principles*.

First principles is a problem-solving approach that breaks things down
to their most fundamental truths and builds up from there—avoiding
assumptions, analogies, or inherited practices. It asks: *What do we
know for certain?* and reasons upward from that foundation.

This approach is critical to me. There should be no ambiguity: Agile
is a discovery process, not one based on unchallenged assumptions.

## ChatGPT on OBAF alignment with Lean

The **Outcome-Based Agile Framework** aligns very well with **Lean
principles**, including those from **Lean Enterprise** and **Lean
Startup**, though with some differences in emphasis. Here’s a detailed
comparison:

---

## 🔁 **Core Alignment with Lean**

### ✅ **Focus on Outcomes and Value (vs. Outputs)**
- **Lean**: Emphasizes customer value and removing waste—build what’s needed, not what’s specified.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Prioritizes solving real problems and achieving meaningful change over delivering predefined features.

✅ **Alignment Score: 10/10**

---

### ✅ **Validated Learning and Experiments**
- **Lean Startup**: Core idea is validated learning through **Build-Measure-Learn** loops.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Embeds continuous discovery and treats delivery as experiment-driven learning. Outcomes are **measurable changes**, not assumptions.

✅ **Alignment Score: 10/10**

---

### ✅ **Problem Framing over Solution Prescription**
- **Lean Enterprise**: Advocates understanding customer problems before building.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Elevates problem ownership and deliberately delays defining specific solutions.

✅ **Alignment Score: 9/10**

---

### ✅ **Respect for People and Empowered Teams**
- **Lean**: Encourages decentralized decision-making and frontline ownership.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Emphasizes team autonomy, problem ownership, and leadership as enablers rather than commanders.

✅ **Alignment Score: 9/10**

---

### ✅ **Iterative Development and Fast Feedback**
- **Lean**: Prefers short cycles, small batches, and feedback to reduce risk and accelerate learning.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Encourages 1–2 week cycles, A/B testing, and real-time user validation. Retrospectives are formalized through After Action Reviews (AARs).

✅ **Alignment Score: 10/10**

---

### ✅ **Governance as Enabler, Not Control**
- **Lean Enterprise**: Governance should support experimentation and alignment, not micromanagement.
- **Outcome-Based Agile**: Proposes “Simplicity of Governance” with a supportive, non-controlling role.

✅ **Alignment Score: 8/10**

---

## 🟡 **Where It Differs or Extends Lean**
### 🟠 **No Upfront Requirements**
- **Lean** tends to allow for *just enough* planning and architectural runway.
- **Outcome-Based Agile** leans harder toward **zero upfront features**, focusing exclusively on outcomes and constraints.

🟡 Alignment: Compatible but more extreme in avoiding specs.

---

### 🟠 **Philosophical Framing**
- **Lean** often starts from process efficiency and customer value.
- **Outcome-Based Agile** adds a layer of **intentional philosophy**—it frames the approach as a moral/strategic reset of Agile, not just a process improvement.

🟡 Alignment: Same roots, but Outcome-Based Agile is more manifesto-driven.

---

## ✅ Overall Alignment Summary

| Area | Alignment |
|------|-----------|
| Value orientation | ✅ Excellent |
| Learning mindset | ✅ Excellent |
| Empowered teams | ✅ Excellent |
| Minimal governance | ✅ Strong |
| Iteration & feedback | ✅ Excellent |
| Requirements handling | 🟡 Leaner than Lean |
| Philosophical tone | 🟡 Broader framing |

---

### 🧭 Final Verdict:

**Highly aligned** with Lean Startup and Lean Enterprise principles,
but possibly even **more radical** in pushing responsibility to teams
and avoiding upfront planning. It complements Lean thinking with a
**clear focus on culture, autonomy, and evidence over certainty**.
