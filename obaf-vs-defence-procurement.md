# OBAF vs the Swedish defence procurement process

**DISCLAIMER!**  
This text was generated by ChatGPT-4o and is written in a style similar to
[obaf-vs-lean-alignment.md](obaf-vs-lean-alignment.md).

Unsurprisingly, the Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF) is
fundamentally **incompatible with traditional public procurement
processes** governed by LUFS (Law on Procurement in the Defense and
Security Sector) and LOU (Law on Public Procurement) in Sweden.

This incompatibility reflects a broader structural challenge seen not
only in Sweden, but also across NATO and other allied nations:
**traditional acquisition models struggle to keep pace with disruptive
civilian technologies**, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such
as **drones**, **cyber warfare**, **AI systems**, and **autonomous
platforms**.

The issue is not merely procedural ‚Äî it stems from **an inability to
manage high uncertainty environments**, where solutions cannot be
fully specified upfront but must emerge through discovery and
adaptation.

A striking civilian example of this systemic problem is the troubled
deployment of the **Millennium electronic health record (EHR) system**
in V√§stra G√∂talandsregionen (VGR), Sweden.

- Millennium was procured using **traditional waterfall-style public
  procurement** practices, with highly detailed upfront requirements
  and rigid contracts.
- The project **underestimated complexity**, **locked in technology
  decisions too early**, and **left no room for discovery or
  adaptation** based on real-world clinical workflows.
- As a result, Millennium suffered from **major delays**,
  **significant cost overruns** (billions of SEK), **poor user
  acceptance**, and **operational disruptions** in clinical
  environments.
- Critically, many clinicians and project auditors noted that **early
  warning signs could not be acted upon** because contractual rigidity
  prevented mid-course corrections.

In a procurement model like OBAF, discovery and evidence-based
adaptation would have been embedded from the start, offering a far
greater chance of identifying risks early and iteratively improving
both the system and its deployment.

Some observers ask: *"When will we learn?"* Others recognize: *"We
still have far to walk to reform our institutional approach to
uncertainty, complexity, and real-world learning."*

# OBAF and FMV

‚û°Ô∏è **Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF) is philosophically and practically misaligned with traditional FMV acquisition models,** especially if those models are based on the classic **V-model** and **waterfall** approaches.  
However, **partial integration is possible** if FMV adapts parts of
its process to allow outcome framing and iterative learning *inside* a
controlled acquisition structure.

Here's a **detailed breakdown**:

## ‚ùå Where OBAF and FMV V-Model Clash

| Topic | FMV Acquisition (V-Model/Waterfall) | OBAF |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Requirements Handling | Heavy upfront requirements specification (System Requirements Specification, Functional Specification) | No upfront requirements; only **outcomes** and **constraints** are specified. |
| Planning & Certainty | Emphasizes extensive early planning and detailed, sequential phases. | Accepts uncertainty; discovery happens continuously alongside delivery. |
| Process Flow | Sequential: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance | Iterative and non-linear: Discovery and delivery happen simultaneously in short cycles. |
| Governance | Formal, heavy documentation, reviews, and milestone approvals (especially for defense projects). | Light, enabling governance aimed at supporting autonomy and learning, minimal bureaucracy. |
| Risk Management | Attempts to minimize risk upfront through thorough planning. | Accepts that risk and uncertainty are part of the process and should be managed through evidence and adaptation. |
| Contracts | Often fixed-scope, fixed-price, or fixed-requirements contracts. | Focus on flexible outcomes; scope is emergent based on discovery and learning. |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Where Partial Alignment Could Exist (with Adaptation)

| Topic | FMV Practice | OBAF Approach | Possible Bridge |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Constraints | FMV already uses technical, legal, and security constraints. | OBAF treats constraints seriously, as hard boundaries. | ‚úÖ Constraints framing can bridge OBAF and FMV. |
| Purpose Alignment | FMV projects are often tied to specific operational goals (e.g., capability improvements). | OBAF demands clarity of purpose for each outcome. | ‚úÖ Shared emphasis on "why it matters" can align. |
| Outcome Validation | FMV systems must pass acceptance tests proving they meet needs. | OBAF demands observable real-world change before accepting value delivery. | ‚úÖ Testing against real outcomes can align if acceptance criteria shift from pure technical compliance to operational impact. |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Specific FMV Characteristics That Make Full Adoption of OBAF Hard
- **Defense acquisitions** prioritize reliability, safety, and compliance‚Äîmaking it difficult to tolerate the "explore, fail, learn" mindset.
- **Certainty needs** (budget approval, parliamentary accountability) conflict with OBAF‚Äôs experimental cycles.
- **Procurement rules** (public sector regulations in Sweden) require detailed tender documents, which are hard to reconcile with evolving requirements.

## üß≠ Final Assessment

| Aspect | Alignment Rating |
|:---|:---|
| Core philosophy | ‚ùå Poor alignment |
| Constraints and boundary management | ‚úÖ Possible |
| Purpose and outcome focus | ‚úÖ Good fit |
| Process flow (iterative vs sequential) | ‚ùå Poor alignment |
| Risk and uncertainty management | ‚ùå Different assumptions |

### ‚û°Ô∏è Overall:  
**Low direct compatibility, but partial hybridization is possible** if FMV allows for:
- Early framing of outcomes instead of only detailed specs
- Continuous discovery inside bounded phases
- Contracts that tolerate some level of adaptive learning (e.g., using outcome-based procurement or adaptive contracting)

> **Instead of adapting OBAF to FMV, please tell me how FMV and the law
> LUFS/LOU have to change in order to adapt to OBAF.**

Excellent ‚Äî you're asking the right strategic question: **instead of bending OBAF**, **what would FMV and Swedish law (LUFS/LOU) need to change** to *fully* support a true Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF) approach?

Here's a direct, structured answer:

---

# üö® Necessary Changes for FMV, LUFS, and LOU to Adapt to OBAF

---

## 1. **Shift from Fixed-Scope Procurement to Outcome-Based Procurement**

| Current (LUFS/LOU) | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| Public procurement is mainly focused on purchasing **defined outputs** (products, services, features) at **fixed price** or **defined scope**. | Legally allow contracts where **problems** or **outcomes** are specified, but **solutions** emerge during the engagement. Like specifying ‚Äúimprove radar detection accuracy by 30%‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbuild a radar with X spec.‚Äù |

‚úÖ This requires explicit acceptance of **outcome-framed tenders** and **adaptive delivery models** in LUFS/LOU.

---

## 2. **Support Iterative, Agile Contract Models**

| Current | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| LUFS/LOU prefers traditional contracting: complete upfront documentation ‚Üí fixed tenders ‚Üí winner selected ‚Üí execution according to plan. | Introduce official support for **agile contracts**: framework agreements or "dynamic delivery models" where the vendor and FMV collaborate iteratively toward outcomes, adjusting scope based on discovery. |

‚úÖ Methods like **Dynamic Purchasing Systems** (already allowed under EU procurement law) could be expanded for agile use.

---

## 3. **Embed Continuous Discovery Legally**

| Current | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| Once requirements are locked in a contract, discovery that changes the scope may be legally problematic (risk of illegal direct awards or scope creep). | Allow **pre-negotiated discovery phases** as legal contract elements. These phases can adjust goals based on evidence without needing to re-open procurement. |

‚úÖ This would mean new procurement rules around **"Adaptive Phase Gates"** ‚Äî letting contracts legally evolve within clear constraints.

---

## 4. **Relax Some Transparency/Formalism Rules**

| Current | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| LUFS/LOU emphasize equal treatment, transparency, and avoiding favoritism by requiring detailed upfront evaluation criteria and deliverables. | Create exceptions (or carve-outs) for **innovation-focused, outcome-driven procurements** where transparency focuses on learning processes and discovery effectiveness, not fixed deliverables. |

‚úÖ Similar exceptions exist under EU law for "innovation partnerships," but LUFS would need to broaden them.

---

## 5. **Redefine ‚ÄúBest Value‚Äù Evaluation**

| Current | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| Best value today usually means evaluating cost vs. specification compliance. | Evaluation criteria must shift toward **evidence of learning, ability to adapt**, and **measurable progress toward outcomes** during execution. |

‚úÖ Awarding contracts not just based on price/specs but on vendors‚Äô ability to continuously validate learning would be a radical but necessary shift.

---

## 6. **Change FMV Internal Mindset and Governance**

| Current FMV Behavior | Needed Change |
|:---|:---|
| Heavy reliance on sequential milestones, exhaustive upfront risk elimination, and rigid project control. | Build **learning governance structures**: focus on controlling **outcome achievement** instead of **output delivery**. Shift risk handling to continuous experimentation and validation rather than upfront elimination. |

‚úÖ FMV project managers would need to become **outcome stewards** rather than **compliance officers**.

---

# ‚úçÔ∏è Summary of Necessary Legal and Organizational Changes:

| Area | Specific Change Needed |
|:---|:---|
| Procurement Law (LUFS/LOU) | Allow outcome-based tenders, legalize iterative contracting, permit embedded discovery |
| Contract Models | Introduce agile, adaptive, dynamic contracting frameworks |
| Transparency Rules | Create innovation-focused flexibility around deliverables |
| Evaluation Metrics | Focus on learning ability and outcome progress, not just specs compliance |
| FMV Governance | Shift from output control to outcome enabling |

---

# ‚ö° Bottom Line:
**OBAF requires deep systemic changes**: not just FMV‚Äôs procedures, but **Sweden‚Äôs public procurement laws (LUFS/LOU) would need targeted modernization**.  
Without these shifts, FMV can only "simulate" OBAF inside a fundamentally waterfall acquisition cage ‚Äî not fully realize it.
