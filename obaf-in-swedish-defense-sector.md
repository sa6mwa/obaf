# Outcome-Based Agile in Regulated Environments (Swedish Defense Sector Edition)

**WARNING! This is a temporary measure and certainly not the optimal
solution. However, given the current conditions within the legal
framework in Sweden, this is an unfortunate reality. For a better
approach, please refer to the real [Outcome-Based Agile
Framework](README.md).**

Agile practices are often perceived as incompatible with heavily
regulated sectors like defense, particularly within the Swedish
procurement system governed by FMV (Försvarets materielverk) and
LUFS/LOU. These frameworks emphasize formal requirements,
documentation, and competitive procurement processes. Yet,
adaptability, learning, and outcome-focused delivery are just as
essential here. This guide presents a tailored version of
Outcome-Based Agile designed to work *within* the unique constraints
of FMV-driven defense projects under LUFS/LOU.

## The Challenge: Procurement and Requirements in LUFS/LOU

Swedish public procurement law, including LUFS (Law on Procurement
within the Defense and Security Sector) and LOU (Public Procurement
Act), necessitates formal bidding processes based on structured
requirements. FMV, as the primary defense procurement agency, issues
detailed specifications and demands traceability, auditability, and
compliance throughout the lifecycle.

This often leads to solution-locked contracts, where agility appears
constrained. However, the key lies in how requirements are framed: not
as prescribed designs, but as compliance *constraints* in service of
operational *outcomes*.

## The Shift: From Static Requirements to Outcome-Constrained Agility

Instead of interpreting FMV’s requirements as fixed feature lists,
suppliers and delivery teams should treat them as:

- **Compliance constraints** that define the outer limits of what a
  solution must ensure
- **Verification criteria** that serve as testable gates toward
  validating acceptable solutions
- **Outcomes to achieve** rather than instructions to implement

This approach enables iterative development and adaptive learning
while staying fully aligned with procurement obligations.

## Framework Application within LUFS/LOU Context

### 1. Translate Specifications into Constraint Sets

Early in procurement response and project startup, each formal
requirement from FMV is analyzed and mapped into one of the following:

- Legal or security constraint
- Performance threshold
- Safety/regulatory compliance condition

These are framed as non-negotiable **boundaries** within which
outcomes must be achieved.

### 2. Group Requirements by Operational Outcome

For example, instead of *"Implement radar mode A, B, and C,"* the team
reframes this under an outcome like *"Enable multi-mode radar
performance under X conditions,"* treating each mode as an
*explorable* path to fulfill the overarching goal.

### 3. Use Modular, Traceable Agile Artifacts

Each backlog item or user story is mapped back to one or more FMV
requirement clauses. Documentation, test results, and design artifacts
are automatically linked, providing traceability and audit trails
without halting iterative progress.

### 4. Embed Compliance Into Discovery

Regulatory and FMV liaisons are engaged during sprints. Test readiness
reviews, formal inspections, and verification events are built into
the agile cadence, not separated from it.

### 5. Deliver Compliance Through Evidence

Compliance documentation is generated from real data: test coverage,
validation logs, acceptance criteria, and retrospective reports. These
are structured to match FMV’s verification needs.

## Facilitation Guide: Deploying Outcome-Based Agile in Swedish Defense Procurement

1. **Procurement Decomposition Workshop:** At project initiation, hold
   a workshop with FMV stakeholders to decompose formal requirements
   into constraints and outcomes.
2. **Tender Response Structuring:** When responding to FMV tenders,
   organize proposals around operational outcomes, showing how
   requirements support or are constrained within each.
3. **Sprint Cadence with Regulatory Sync Points:** Design your sprint
   process to include compliance checkpoints and FMV-aligned review
   cycles.
4. **Evidence-First Governance:** Use testing, modeling, and
   documentation artifacts to show fulfillment of LUFS/LOU constraints
   with each increment.
5. **Training and Internal Coaching:** Prepare engineering,
   compliance, and procurement teams with education around how to
   maintain agility within the LUFS/LOU legal and operational context.

## Conclusion

Swedish defense delivery under LUFS and FMV regulation can support an
agile, outcome-focused approach. By reframing requirements as
constraints and outcomes, suppliers can build adaptive, user-centered
systems that meet the rigorous standards of the Swedish procurement
ecosystem. This approach reduces risk, increases learning, and ensures
that what gets delivered aligns with real operational value—without
compromising formal compliance.

Outcomes and compliance are not in conflict. With the right framing,
they are complementary.
