# OBAF vs SAFe

**DISCLAIMER!**  
*This text was generated by ChatGPT-4o. It reflects a professional
comparison between the Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF) and the
Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), based on publicly available
descriptions of both. Interpretations of SAFe may vary depending on
its implementation context.*

**Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF)** and the **Scaled Agile
Framework (SAFe)** share some surface-level similarities, but **they
differ significantly in philosophy, structure, and intent**. Here's a
detailed breakdown of how well they align:

---

## 🟡 1. **Shared Language — But Different Meaning**
Both OBAF and SAFe use terms like:
- *Outcomes*
- *Lean*
- *Value delivery*
- *Alignment*

**However:**
- In **SAFe**, "outcomes" often translate into defined **business objectives**, **OKRs**, or **feature delivery targets**, typically tracked through hierarchical plans.
- In **OBAF**, outcomes are strictly defined as **observable behavioral or systemic change**, not just deliverables or roadmap milestones.

✅ **Alignment: Superficial vocabulary, but divergent meaning.**

---

## ❌ 2. **Approach to Requirements and Scope**
- **SAFe** relies on epics, capabilities, features, and user stories with a **structured backlog hierarchy** and **upfront planning** via Program Increment (PI) planning.
- **OBAF** explicitly rejects upfront requirements, feature backlogs, or fixed scopes—teams start with problems and constraints, not outputs.

🚫 **Alignment: Fundamentally misaligned.**

---

## ❌ 3. **Governance and Control**
- **SAFe** implements **centralized governance**, budgeting, and coordination across multiple Agile Release Trains (ARTs). It emphasizes predictability, alignment, and high program-level visibility.
- **OBAF** advocates **minimal governance**, decentralized problem ownership, and *evidence over certainty*. It favors learning over predictability.

🚫 **Alignment: Poor—SAFe is highly structured; OBAF is radically adaptive.**

---

## ✅ 4. **Continuous Discovery and Feedback**
- **SAFe** does encourage **customer feedback**, **system demos**, and **Inspect & Adapt** sessions, which are meant to provide learning loops.
- **OBAF** builds discovery into its core—it is non-negotiable and continuous, not periodic.

🟡 **Alignment: Conceptually aligned, but OBAF goes much deeper.**

---

## 🟡 5. **Leadership Role**
- **SAFe** repositions leaders as Lean-Agile enablers, but still expects them to **set strategic direction via roadmaps and epics**.
- **OBAF** expects leaders to define only **intent and constraints**, leaving solution space fully to teams.

🟡 **Alignment: Some shared leadership principles, but OBAF demands more autonomy.**

---

## ✅ 6. **Strategic Intent and Purpose Alignment**
- Both frameworks emphasize **mission clarity**, **value streams**, and **connecting work to strategy**.
- **OBAF** places stronger emphasis on “*why the outcome matters*” as the anchor for all work.

✅ **Alignment: High-level strategic intent is well-aligned.**

---

## ❌ 7. **Scale and Complexity Handling**
- **SAFe** is specifically designed for **large-scale, complex organizations**—it brings order to chaos.
- **OBAF** assumes complexity is natural and embraces emergent behavior; it is **skeptical of top-down coordination**, especially across many teams.

🚫 **Alignment: Conflicting assumptions about how to handle scale.**

## ✅ Summary Table: OBAF vs. SAFe Alignment

| Area                          | Alignment |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Terminology                   | 🟡 Superficial only |
| Discovery and Feedback        | ✅ Conceptually similar |
| Requirements and Planning     | ❌ Opposed |
| Governance                    | ❌ Opposed |
| Leadership Philosophy         | 🟡 Some overlap |
| Strategic Intent Connection   | ✅ Strong alignment |
| Scaling Assumptions           | ❌ Incompatible |

---

## 🎯 Final Verdict

**OBAF and SAFe are not directly compatible.**  
SAFe is structured for **predictable execution at scale**, while OBAF is optimized for **uncertain problem spaces, adaptive learning, and decentralized ownership**.  
An organization adopting SAFe would need to **strip away or radically reinterpret many of SAFe’s core practices** to align with OBAF principles.

# 🧨 Subverting SAFe from Within

> The content reflects a perspective rooted in the **Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF)** and is intentionally provocative in its framing. “Subverting SAFe” refers to reinterpreting or evolving its practices toward a more outcome-oriented, evidence-driven model—not undermining teams or leadership.

## A Transition Path Toward Outcome-Based Agility

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is often adopted to bring order to large enterprises. But over time, its structure can become rigid—full of roles, rituals, and backlogs that optimize predictability, not learning.  
If you're working within SAFe but believe in OBAF's core values—**problem-first thinking**, **evidence over assumptions**, **discovery before delivery**—this guide is for you.

---

## 🔁 1. Reframe Epics as Outcome Hypotheses
- SAFe Epics are often scoped with defined features and acceptance criteria.
- ✅ **Instead:** Treat epics as **outcome experiments** with a hypothesis:
  > *“We believe doing X will lead to a measurable change in Y.”*

➡️ Shift the definition of “Done” from *delivered* to *validated*.

---

## 🚫 2. Delay Feature Commitment
- SAFe PI Planning pressures teams to commit to feature sets upfront.
- ✅ **Instead:** Identify **problem spaces**, not features, during PI Planning.
- Ask: “What do we not know yet?” and **plan discovery spikes** rather than delivery sprints.

➡️ Use "Enablers" in SAFe as a loophole for ongoing discovery.

---

## 📉 3. Undermine Story Point Worship
- SAFe teams often track velocity and burn-downs.
- ✅ **Instead:** Measure **progress toward the desired outcome**, not story point throughput.
- Use metrics like behavior change, adoption rate, or impact, not just delivery.

➡️ Refocus retrospectives on **value learning**, not velocity gaps.

---

## 🧭 4. Shift Leadership from Roadmaps to Intent
- SAFe encourages roadmap planning at Portfolio and Program levels.
- ✅ **Instead:** Work with leaders to define only **intent + constraints** (OBAF-style).
- Say: “Tell us what matters and where not to go. Let us figure out the rest.”

➡️ Replace roadmap features with **problem statements** on your ART board.

---

## 👥 5. Replace ART Alignment with Outcome Alignment
- ARTs are designed to align multiple teams on delivery cadence.
- ✅ **Instead:** Use ART syncs and Inspect & Adapt (I&A) sessions to align around **user impact**.
- Ask each team to answer: “What observable change are we trying to achieve?”

➡️ Use shared metrics and After Action Reviews (AARs) to create real alignment.

---

## 🧪 6. Rewire System Demos into Learning Reviews
- SAFe demos are often just “what we built.”
- ✅ **Instead:** Ask “What did we learn?” and “How did behavior change?”
- Show failed experiments and **non-obvious findings**, not just functioning code.

➡️ Normalize the value of invalidated assumptions.

---

## 🛡️ 7. Protect Discovery Time Like Delivery Time
- SAFe teams often treat discovery as a second-class activity.
- ✅ **Instead:** Carve out **protected discovery cycles** in your team calendar.
- Label them “enablers,” “spikes,” or “tech investigations”—whatever passes audit.

➡️ Make learning visible, fund it, and defend it.

---

## 🧘 8. Coach Blameless Culture in a Role-Centric System
- SAFe formalizes roles (RTE, PM, SM), which can reinforce hierarchy.
- ✅ **Instead:** Build a team culture around **shared accountability for outcomes**.
- Use After Action Reviews (AARs) to regularly examine what happened, without blame.

➡️ Separate performance reviews from retrospectives to preserve honesty.

---

## 🎯 Final Advice

You can’t replace SAFe overnight. But you can **reshape how people experience it**. Start with language:
- From **feature** → to **behavioral outcome**
- From **velocity** → to **learning velocity**
- From **compliance** → to **intent**
- From **planning certainty** → to **adaptive strategy**

OBAF isn’t about rejecting structure—it’s about making sure structure serves *learning and impact*, not ritual.
