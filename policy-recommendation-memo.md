**Policy Recommendation Memo**

**Subject:** Modernizing FMV Acquisition and Swedish Procurement Law to Enable Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF)

**To:** Leadership, Försvarets Materielverk (FMV)
**Cc:** Swedish Procurement Policy Taskforce, Ministry of Defence

## Executive Summary

FMV’s current acquisition practices, based on the V-Model and waterfall project structures, are incompatible with modern adaptive frameworks such as the Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF). To enable FMV to deliver higher-value, faster-adapting capabilities in a complex world, changes to both internal governance and national procurement law (LUFS/LOU) are required. This memo outlines the necessary reforms to align Swedish defence acquisition practices with outcome-driven, evidence-based delivery models.

## Core Recommendations

### 1. Reform LUFS/LOU to Permit Outcome-Based Procurement
- Amend procurement regulations to allow contracts where only **desired outcomes** and **constraints** are specified, rather than detailed technical solutions.
- Recognize "outcome-based tenders" as a formal, legal procurement method.

### 2. Introduce Agile and Adaptive Contracting Models
- Develop and permit new contract templates supporting **iterative, evidence-driven delivery**.
- Enable "Dynamic Delivery Agreements" allowing scope to evolve within controlled discovery phases without triggering re-tendering.

### 3. Embed Discovery as a Legally Recognized Phase
- Allow contracts to explicitly include early-stage **discovery work** (hypothesis validation, solution exploration) as part of the delivery lifecycle.
- Treat discovery results as inputs for adaptive refinement rather than breaches of original contracts.

### 4. Expand Transparency Exceptions for Innovation
- Create specific carve-outs in LUFS/LOU for **innovation-focused procurements**, where deliverables cannot be fully defined upfront.
- Focus transparency requirements on discovery processes and learning milestones, rather than fixed outputs.

### 5. Redefine "Best Value" in Public Procurement
- Update evaluation criteria to prioritize:
  - Vendor’s ability to manage uncertainty.
  - Vendor’s learning speed and evidence validation.
  - Observable progress toward real-world outcomes.

### 6. Transform FMV’s Internal Governance
- Shift FMV’s project oversight model from "output control" to "outcome stewardship."
- Train FMV program managers to facilitate continuous discovery and delivery cycles.
- Introduce lightweight governance that supports team autonomy within clear strategic constraints.

## Benefits of Transition

- **Accelerated Capability Delivery**: Faster adaptation to operational needs.
- **Risk Reduction Through Evidence**: Real-world validation reduces large-scale program failures.
- **Better Alignment with Modern Defense Challenges**: Agile response to emerging technologies and threat landscapes.
- **Higher Value for Money**: Focus on real impact rather than procedural compliance.

## Conclusion

For FMV to maintain its mission effectiveness in an increasingly complex and fast-changing defense environment, a fundamental shift from requirement-centric, sequential acquisition toward outcome-driven, adaptive acquisition is necessary. This requires a coordinated effort to modernize LUFS/LOU and transform FMV’s internal governance structures accordingly.

We recommend establishing a joint FMV-Ministry-Procurement Authority taskforce to design a pilot initiative based on these principles within the next 12 months.
