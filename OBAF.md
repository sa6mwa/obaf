# The Outcome-Based Agile Framework

In a world where agile has often been diluted into process rituals
without purpose, the *Outcome-Based Agile Framework* reclaims its core
intent: to create meaningful change through adaptive learning and
value delivery. Inspired by the original
[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), this framework defines
a model where teams are driven by **outcomes**, **not requirements**,
and guided by evidence, not assumption.

## Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of creating value by focusing on
outcomes rather than outputs. Through this work, we have come to
value:

- **Outcomes over requirements**  
Because solving problems matters more than delivering predetermined
solutions.
- **Constraints over scope**  
Because framing the problem is more productive than prescribing its
answer.
- **Discovery over certainty**  
Because we can’t predict value—we must find it through learning.
- **Accountability to results over compliance to plans**  
Because teams should be responsible for making change, not just
delivering work.
- **Alignment on intent over agreement on features**  
Because shared goals outlast specific ideas.

That is, while there is value in outputs, defined scopes, and planned
features,  
**we value the ability to learn and adapt toward real outcomes far
more.**

## Framework Tenets

### 1. No Upfront Requirements

Work does not begin with a list of features, specifications, or
outputs. Teams begin with problems to solve and outcomes to
achieve. The only fixed inputs are constraints.

### 2. Clarify the Purpose of the Outcome

Ensure the team understands why the outcome matters—its strategic,
operational, or user-centered importance—before starting the work.

### 3. Problem Ownership Over Task Execution

Teams are given ownership of a problem and trusted to determine how
best to solve it within the defined boundaries.

### 4. Outcomes Are Observable Changes

An outcome is a measurable shift in user behavior, business value, or
system performance. Delivery is only valuable if it contributes to
these shifts.

### 5. Constraints Define Limits, Not Solutions

Constraints—technical, legal, ethical, or otherwise—are real and
respected. They inform exploration but must not dictate the final form
of a solution.

### 6. Continuous Discovery Is Mandatory

Discovery and delivery happen together. Teams explore problems, test
assumptions (solution hypotheses), and validate ideas in real time.

### 7. Evidence Is the Arbiter

All decisions are made based on learning from real users and
data. **Plans are hypotheses**, not contracts.

### 8. Strategy Is Intent, Not Instruction

Leaders set direction through vision and desired outcomes, not through
detailed feature roadmaps.

### 9. Simplicity of Governance

Governance exists to support autonomy and learning. It must be light,
minimal, and enabling—never controlling.

### 10. Regular Blameless Retrospectives Through After Action Reviews (AAR)

Teams must conduct regular retrospectives at intervals appropriate to
their context (after iterations, deliveries, daily, weekly, or
combinations). The recommended format is the *After Action Review*
(AAR), which uses four blameless and structured questions:

- **What was supposed to happen?** (What was planned?)
- **What happened?** (What actually occurred?)
- **Why did it happen?** (Root causes and contributing factors)
- **What did we learn?** (Key insights and adaptations)

Each question is discussed separately and sequentially by the entire
team. Conversations about "what was planned," "what happened," and
"why" must be isolated from each other to avoid conflating facts and
analysis. Learning points can be documented at any time in the "what
did we learn" section.

Differences in team members' understanding are celebrated as learning
opportunities rather than treated as errors. The goal is not for all
team members to have identical views but to explore the richness of
different perspectives.

It is considered rude to interrupt team members while they are
speaking. The facilitator should ensure that each team member has the
opportunity to speak without interruption and can finish sharing their
thoughts before others respond.

Importantly, the "what did we learn" section, including any optional
recording in a knowledge base, must never include the names of
individual team members. Only lessons learned, without attribution to
specific people, are captured to ensure a fully blameless environment
that fosters openness and continuous improvement.

## How to Apply This Framework

Organizations adopting Outcome-Based Agile should begin by clearly
defining the outcomes they seek. These outcomes should not only be
real, measurable changes in user or business behavior but also have a
clearly articulated purpose. Clarifying *why* each outcome matters
helps ensure alignment across teams, guides prioritization, and
connects day-to-day work to broader organizational goals.

Teams should be cross-functional, capable of discovery and delivery,
and given end-to-end responsibility for their outcomes.

**Roadmaps become hypothesis backlogs**. Requirements become
constraints. Progress is measured not by story points, but by progress
toward the desired change.

Leadership must shift from steering work to enabling learning. Teams
must shift from implementing solutions to exploring possibilities. And
the organization must create space for evidence to matter more than
certainty.

## Simple Process Overview

1. **Input:** Outcome + Constraints
2. **Process:** Discovery + Delivery (Iterative)
3. **Output:** Validated Experiments, Prototypes, and Releases
4. **Outcome:** Real-world change (measured)
5. **Feedback Loop:** After Action Reviews (AARs) inform learning and
   next steps

## Facilitation Guide

1. **Kickoff Workshop:** Define the outcomes, clarify the purpose
   behind each outcome, surface constraints, and establish team
   autonomy
2. **Cadence Design:** Establish short cycles of delivery and feedback
   (e.g., 1-2 weeks)
3. **Feedback Loops:** Embed continuous discovery methods (user
   interviews, A/B tests, analytics reviews)
4. **Review Rituals:** Use retrospectives in the form of AARs to focus
   on what was planned, what happened, why it happened, and what was
   learned
5. **Leadership Coaching:** Train sponsors and managers to support
   outcome framing, not output control

## Key Reminders

* If you are writing a solution before exploring the problem, pause.
* If requirements are treated as fixed outputs, reframe them as
  boundaries.
* If retrospectives assign blame, reset the culture.
* If decisions ignore evidence, restart the discovery.

## Conclusion

Outcome-Based Agile is not a methodology; it is a recommitment to what
agility was always meant to be: adaptive, user-centered, and
value-focused. It is a call to drop the illusion of control in favor
of the pursuit of clarity, progress, and real-world impact.

**Outcomes, not outputs. Always.**
